## Image Recognition System for Service Monitoring

## Situation:

- VMware faced prolonged downtime and missed SLA targets due to slow and inefficient detection of service anomalies from images. 
- The delay in identifying and addressing issues led to service disruptions and a decrease in customer satisfaction.

## Task:

- The goal was to develop an automated image recognition system to quickly identify service anomalies, minimize downtime, and ensure SLAs were met consistently.   
- The solution needed to improve the speed and accuracy of anomaly detection from images.




## Action:

- Implemented a transfer learning approach using pre-trained models like Xception and MobileNet for efficient image classification.
-   Integrated a Multi-Head Attention Mechanism to focus on relevant features and speed up the detection process, resulting in more precise anomaly identification.

## Result:
- The new system reduced downtime by 40%, enabling quicker issue resolution and improved SLA compliance. 
- Additionally, the solution increased service reliability and enhanced customer satisfaction by proactively addressing anomalies.
