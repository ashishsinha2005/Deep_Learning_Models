## Top-Down Revenue Forecast for Current Quarter and Next 2 Quarters 

- The organization needed a reliable forecasting mechanism to accurately project revenue for the current quarter and the next two quarters, ensuring a consistent sales rhythm.
-  Existing approaches lacked precision, particularly in early stages of the quarter, hindering effective planning and resource allocation.

## Situation:

The objective was to build a forecasting solution with high accuracy to enable better sales cadence and informed decision-making. The solution needed to deliver reliable revenue predictions starting from week 4 of the quarter.

## Task:

A machine learning approach was implemented to address the challenge:
-	Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to balance the dataset, improving the model’s ability to predict successful outcomes.
-	Logistic Regression was applied to estimate the likelihood of deals closing within the current quarter based on historical deal data and relevant features.


## Action:

A robust forecasting model was developed using advanced analytics techniques:
-	Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA),neural network with tensor flow & keras was implemented to analyze revenue patterns and predict future performance based on historical trends.
-	Regression analysis was employed to incorporate additional influencing factors, such as sales activities and market conditions, enhancing the model’s precision.
-	Regular updates and iterative improvements were made to ensure alignment with real-time data.




## Result:
- The model achieved an impressive 95% accuracy in revenue predictions from week 4 of the quarter, significantly improving sales rhythm. 
- The solution enabled proactive planning and resource allocation, ensuring alignment with organizational goals.
- This project highlighted the power of data-driven forecasting in achieving operational efficiency and strategic alignment.
