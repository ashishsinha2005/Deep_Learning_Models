## Virtual Machine Image Compliance Validation

## Situation:

- Cloud environments faced increasing security vulnerabilities and inefficiencies due to non-compliance with regulatory policies.
- These gaps posed risks to system performance, data integrity, and overall operational reliability.

## Task:

- The objective was to design an automated solution to validate virtual machine images for compliance with security and regulatory standards.
-  This system aimed to minimize manual effort while improving efficiency and reducing the likelihood of breaches.



## Action:

- Developed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch to automate the compliance validation of virtual machine images.  
- The model was trained to detect non-compliance patterns, ensuring consistent and accurate validation.



## Result:
- The solution reduced manual validation efforts by 50%, saving significant time and resources. 
- It also strengthened security measures and ensured consistent adherence to regulatory requirements across cloud systems.

## Additional Notes

Neural network classification is a machine learning approach where a 
neural network is used to categorize input data into predefined classes 
or labels. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons: an 
input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron 
applies a mathematical transformation to its inputs and passes the result 
to the next layer. The network learns by adjusting the connections 
(weights) between neurons to minimize the error in predictions, typically 
measured by a loss function. This process allows the neural network to 
generalize and correctly classify new, unseen data
